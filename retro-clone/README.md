# Retro Portfolio

I am working through the p1xt guide ["Get Job ready - JavaScript Edition - Version 2.0"](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-javascript-edition-2.0.md). This repository is to hold all of the frontend designs I make during this. All designs are based off of the work of others.

Live site: [Retro Portfolio Clone](https://reuben-john.github.io/html-css-templates/retro-clone/)

This site is cloned from the wonderful ["New Retro Portfolio v4"](https://themeforest.net/item/retro-portfolio-one-page-vintage-wordpress-theme/1708109) by [Pasquale Vitiello](http://pasqualevitiello.com/). I originally started using the [PSD from here](https://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/new-retro-portfolio-v4-free-psd/) then [saw the site in action here](https://themeforest.net/item/retro-portfolio-one-page-vintage-wordpress-theme/1708109) where it is for sale.

It is not an exact clone. I kept some of the stylings that I enjoyed. Once I figure out a color pallete I enjoy, I will be updating the site with new colors.
