# HTML & CSS Templates

I am working through the p1xt guide ["Get Job ready - JavaScript Edition - Version 2.0"](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-javascript-edition-2.0.md). This repository is to hold all of the frontend designs I make during this. All designs are based off of the work of others.

Templates will be added to the list below as I finish them.
